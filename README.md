# SI-AMP
SI-AMP algorithm

## Introduction
The code implements the proposed algorithm GENP-AMP in the paper “Approximate Message Passing-based Compressed Sensing Reconstruction with Generalized Elastic Net Prior” (http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0576) and reproduces the experimental parts.

## Requirements

  1.	Mathworks MATLAB release 2009b or later

  2.	The CVX software package, (available at http://cvxr.com/cvx/ )

  3.	The GAMP software package, (available from from Sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gampmatlab/files/), installed and included in MATLAB's path.

  All related software packages are included in the document. If the readers want to get the latest version, please download from the webpages above.


## Installation instructions:

  1.	Install the CVX package from http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/  and include the folders in MATLAB’s path.

  2.	Install the GAMP software packages from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gampmatlab/files/  and include the folders in MATLAB’s path

  3.	The multi-view dataset can be downloaded from http://www.fujii.nuee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/multiview-data/ .

## Usage

How to use SI-OWLQN:

  * Save the data into .mtx format ,e.g., 

    [ err1 ] = mmwrite( 'A_matrix.mtx',A); % %

    [ err2 ] = mmwrite( 'y_matrix.mtx',Y); %

    [ err3 ] = mmwrite( 'SI_matrix.mtx',x_SI); %

    [ err4 ] = mmwrite('x_matrix.mtx',x);

    The mmwrite and mmread programme have been included in sub-folder "solver".

  * cd to comparison algorithms\SI-OWLQN

  * The input format should be like this: SI-OWLQN  x_matrix.mtx  A_matrix.mtx  y_matrix.mtx  SI_matrix.mtx  lambda  output.mtx  –l2weight  tau
  
    Then mmread function is applied to read output.mtx into matlab and the MSE can be calculated.
